Welcome to the GitHub repo for Taweret, the state of the art Python package for applying Bayesian Model Mixing! 

## About
Taweret is a new generalized package to help with applying Bayesian model mixing methods, developed by members of the BAND collaboration, to a wide variety of problems in physics. 

## Features
At present, this package possesses the following BMM methods:
- Linear model mixing ( With simultaneous model mixing and calibration)
- Multivariate BMM 
- Bayesian Trees

## Documentation
See Taweret's docs webpage [here](https://taweretorg.github.io/Taweret/).
