Welcome to the GitHub repo for Taweret, the state of the art Python package for applying Bayesian Model Mixing to exciting nuclear physics! 

## About
Taweret is a new generalized package to help with applying Bayesian model mixing methods, developed by members of the BAND collaboration, to a wide variety of problems in physics. 

## Features
At present, this package possesses the following BMM methods:
- Linear model mixing 
- Multivariate BMM 
- Bayesian Trees

## Documentation
See Taweret's docs webpage [here](https://danosu.github.io/Taweret/index.html).
